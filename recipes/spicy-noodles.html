                    <li>2 medium green onions, thinly sliced</li>
                </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Whisk soy sauce, sesame oil, brown sugar, rice vinegar, chili garlic sauce, and ginger together in a small bowl.</li>
                    <li>Add peanut butter, whisking until well combined, and set aside</li>
                    <li>Bring 4 cups of water to boil in a pot. Discard the flavour packet and add ramen noodles to the boiling water. Cook until noodles are tender, 4-5 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Drain noodles, reserving some of the noodle water in case you need to thin out the sauce later.</li>
                    <li>Pour sauce over ramen noodles, tossing until well coated. If sauce is too thick, thin out with a small amount of the reserved noodle water until you reach your desired consistency.</li>
                    <li>Garnish with peanuts and green onion, and serve.</li>
                </ol>
