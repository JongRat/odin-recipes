        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This recipe is for another favourite of mine (you might have a spotted trend): Spicy Pizza that serves 4!</p>
            <p>This recipe is remarkably simple, and of course, because it's pizza: toppings can be substituted in and out with complete ease. As such this makes a great recipe to build off of for your own personal tastes!</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 ball pizza dough</li>
                <li>0.75 cup pizza sauce</li>
                <li>1.5 cup monterey jack (shredded)</li>
                <li>3oz sliced ham</li>
                <li>1 medium jalapeño</li>
            </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 220. Allow pizza dough to come to room temperature if frozen or chilled.</li>
                <li>On a lightly flourd surface, stretch the dough into a 16 inch round base. Spray a perforated pizza tray with non-stick spray and transfer the stretched dough onto the tray.</li>
                <li>Spread the pizza sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a one inch area of crust around the ourside edge.</li>
                <li>Top with diced ham slices and thinly sliced jalapeño. (Or with toppings of your choosing!)</li>
                <li>Bake in the oven for 15-20 minutes or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly. Enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
