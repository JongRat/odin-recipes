        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Despite not being spicy, like my other recipes so far, this is still a favourite of mine, and does have &lsquo;ease of making&rsquo; in common with those recipes!</p>
            <p>And, as always, this recipe serves very well as a baseline to add and remove from to suit your own tastes and preferences.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>8oz bow tie pasta</li>
                <li>8oz frozen broccoli florets</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
                <li>1lb boneless, skinless chicken breast</li>
                <li>0.33 cup basil pesto</li>
                <li>0.5 cup chicken broth</li>
                <li>4oz cream cheese</li>
            </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Bring a large pot to boil for the pasta. Once it reaches a full boil, add the pasta and continue to boil just until the pasta is tender, but still slightly firm in the center.</li>
                <li>Add the frozen broccoli florets to the water with the pasta and continue to cook for 2-3 more minutes, or until the broccoli is tender. Drain the pasta and broccoli in a colander.</li>
                <li>While the pasta is cooking, cut the chicken breast into 0.5-inch pieces. Heat one tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add the chicken and continue to cook until the outside of the chicken pieces are white, but they're still tender in the center.</li>
                <li>Add the chicken broth to the skillet with the chicken and allow it to heat through.</li>
                <li>Once hot, add the cream cheese (in small pieces) and pesto.</li>
                <li>Continue to stir and cook until the cream cheese has melted and created a smooth, creamy sauce with the pesto and chicken broth.</li>
                <li>Finally, add the cooked and drained pasta and broccoli to the skillet and stir to coat it in the cream sauce. If the sauce is too thick, add another splash of chicken broth to loosen it up. Enjoy!</li>
